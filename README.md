# **Steps to make a Repo**

### What to do in IDE

- Get to github-learning by using _cd github-learning_
  - Make the repotest directory by using _mkdir repotest_
    - Get into repotest by doing _cd repotest_
    - Use _git init_ to put repotest into the staging area
    - Use _touch README.md_ to make a READ ME
    - _c9 README.md_ to get into READ ME
    - Add whatever you want
    - _git add README.md_ so you can commit it
    - Then use _git commit -m "message"_ to commit your message

### What to do in github (Do steps above first)

- You also want to create a repo in [github](github.com) called repotest
  - Copy this code
    - _git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/reponame.git_
    - _git push -u origin master_
    - This code should appear in github when you make a repo

  - Go back to IDE and paste the code in
    - Now you can use _git push_ and push changes everytime you add and commit something
    - It might ask you for your Username and your Password
